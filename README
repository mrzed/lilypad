# Lilypad Built from lil 0.3 README
# Original README: README.cratylus

Starting from the base lil 0.3 mudlib and fluffos 2.23
driver, I am building a mud and security system. It
will include basic mud functionality and commands that
all muds have, which this lil build currently lacks.
------------------------------------------------------


Updated README from MrZed (zed):
--------------------------------

This is a repackaging of the Lil mudlib. It is
incredibly barebones...you get a few commands, and
that's it. This is for folks interested in making
their own "from scratch" lib. Strictly speaking it
isn't "from scratch" if you use it, but man, it's close.

Please note that since you are still using the
FluffOS driver, your mud's use will be subject 
to the MudOS and LPMud licenses.

There is no official support for this. 
If you're actually planning to use
this it's because you are a hardcore...and I mean
*hard* *core*, do-it-yourselfer. So, do it yourself.

Instructions:
-------------

* type: cd fluffos-2.23-ds03/
* type: ./configure
* type: make
* type: make install
* type: cd ../bin
* type: vi lilypad.cfg
* type: ./driver ./lilypad.cfg &
