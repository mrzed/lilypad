This lib is in early beginnings. Right now anyone can shutdown
the mud as no security is in place. Only account cration and
the following commands currently function in this little lib:

    dest, update, ed, eval, efun, rm, say, who, quit, and shutdown.

All of update, dest, ed, and rm require full pathnames as arguments.

Have fun.
