This lib is in early beginnings. There is a very basic secsurity
system in place that seperates commands in the following ways:

Players:
    say, who, and quit (help is just being developed)

Creators:
    all player commands, cd, dest, ed, eval, ls, pwd, rm, speed,
    and update

Admins:
    all creator commands, player commands, codefor, promote,
    shutdown, and tests. demote is being developed.

Note: update, dest, ed, and rm require full pathnames as arguments.

Have fun.
