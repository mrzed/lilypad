This is a development MUD named Lilypad. It is based on the
testsuite mudlib known as lil. Things may work, and they may
not. Don't get mad at me if they are hosed - this is, as
stated, a mudlib under EXTREME development. The source I am
working with can be found at GitHub, as is the original
source.
